## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- `--format <tty|plain|agent|json>` selects the output format explicitly.
  Without it, ferritin autodetects as before: agent format under a coding agent,
  ANSI on a TTY, plain when piped.
- `--format json` prints a structured model of the result rather than rendered
  text. `get` emits the item as its kind's own shape — a struct's fields, an
  enum's variants, a trait's members and every one of its implementors, a
  module's children, a type's trait impls — each type reference carrying the
  path or URL it points at, and each code block carrying syntax-highlight
  classes. `search` and `list` emit their results the same way. It cannot be
  combined with `--interactive`.
- Unions render like structs. They were previously `[not yet implemented]`.
- Negative impls (`impl !Send for T`) appear among a type's trait impls,
  prefixed with `!`. They were previously dropped.
- Reads rustdoc JSON format version 60.
- A `serve` cargo feature, off by default, adds a `ferritin serve` subcommand
  that runs a documentation web server. Distributed binaries are built without
  it.

### Changed

- **`--agent` and its `--ai` alias are removed**; use `--format agent`.
  Autodetection from `CLAUDECODE`/`GEMINI_CLI`/`CODEX_SANDBOX` is unchanged.
- Resolving a bare crate name — or any requirement the newest release satisfies
  — no longer asks crates.io. ferritin keeps its own copy of the crates.io
  name→version table in `$CARGO_HOME/rustdoc-json/crate-names/`, fetched once
  (~7.5 MB compressed) and revalidated hourly in the background. So resolution
  works offline once the table is on disk, and it can lag crates.io by up to a
  day: a release published this morning may still resolve to yesterday's
  version. A requirement that excludes the newest release, and a crate published
  since the table was built, still reach the crates.io API.
- Following a link into another crate loads the version the crate you queried
  was *built against*, rather than the newest release or whatever the
  referencing crate happened to record. Items reached through `std::vec::Vec`
  into `alloc`, or through a dependency's re-export, now come from the versions
  that crate actually compiles against, and no longer depend on the order you
  navigated in.
- Fetching a crate from docs.rs takes one request instead of up to seven, and
  waits 30 seconds rather than 2 — cold fetches of large crates were timing out
  and reporting the crate as unavailable. A release whose rustdoc JSON predates
  format 55 is now reported unavailable rather than probed for.
- A failed docs.rs fetch is retried after a short interval instead of being
  remembered for the life of the process. In the TUI, a network blip no longer
  makes a crate unavailable for the rest of the session.
- Search ranking is retuned and result order will differ throughout. Names weigh
  more heavily against prose than before, and long prose that dwells on a term
  can outrank the item named for it — for documentation search that is usually
  the page you want, and the named item lands just below it.
- Search matches a name prefix on the final word of a query, so results appear
  before you finish typing (`Vec::pu` reaches `push`), including at interior
  word boundaries (`set` reaches `TypeSet`).
- A query naming both a container and a member (`hashmap insert`) finds
  `HashMap::insert`. Items are indexed under their ancestors' names as well as
  their own, weighted by distance.
- The caches under `$CARGO_HOME/rustdoc-json/` changed format: the first lookup
  of each crate after upgrading re-parses its JSON and rebuilds its search
  index. The superseded `.rkyv1-*` sidecars are not cleaned up — delete them to
  reclaim the disk.

### Fixed

- Looking up an item in a large family of crates that glob-re-export each other
  (the ~40 `solana-*` crates found this) could overflow the stack and abort
  ferritin. Over-deep resolution is now abandoned the way a cycle is.
- Crates with deeply nested generic types — anything leaning on `typenum` —
  failed to load at all.
- Searching a crate for a term its documentation uses everywhere, its own name
  included, ranked the best matches last: `Regex` was unfindable in a search of
  `regex`.
- docs.rs links for a crate whose library name differs from its package name
  (`sha-1`, whose lib is `sha1`) pointed at a 404.
- Links to attribute and derive macros pointed at `macro.{name}.html`, which
  404s for both.
- A relative link in a crate's prose (`struct.TcpStream.html`) resolved against
  the crate root rather than the module the page is rendered in, reaching the
  wrong item or none.
- A docs.rs URL written out by hand in a doc comment now resolves to the item it
  names and navigates in place, instead of being treated as an ordinary external
  link.
- The TUI status line's key hints vanished on the first mouse move and stayed
  gone for the session.
- A crate could fail to resolve when its version metadata couldn't be written to
  the cache directory, and two ferritin processes resolving the same crate at
  once could race over that file.
