## [0.8.1](https://github.com/jbr/ferritin/compare/rustdoc-mcp-v0.8.0...rustdoc-mcp-v0.8.1) - 2026-07-17

### Other

- updated the following local packages: ferritin-common

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Reads rustdoc JSON format version 60.

### Changed

- Resolving a bare crate name — or any requirement the newest release satisfies
  — no longer asks crates.io. rustdoc-mcp keeps its own copy of the crates.io
  name→version table in `$CARGO_HOME/rustdoc-json/crate-names/`, fetched once
  (~7.5 MB compressed) and revalidated hourly in the background. So resolution
  works offline once the table is on disk, and it can lag crates.io by up to a
  day: a release published this morning may still resolve to yesterday's
  version. A requirement that excludes the newest release, and a crate published
  since the table was built, still reach the crates.io API.
- Following a link into another crate loads the version the crate you queried
  was *built against*, rather than the newest release or whatever the
  referencing crate happened to record. Items reached through `std::vec::Vec`
  into `alloc`, or through a dependency's re-export, now come from the versions
  that crate actually compiles against, and no longer depend on the order they
  were requested in.
- Fetching a crate from docs.rs takes one request instead of up to seven, and
  waits 30 seconds rather than 2 — cold fetches of large crates were timing out
  and reporting the crate as unavailable. A release whose rustdoc JSON predates
  format 55 is now reported unavailable rather than probed for.
- A failed docs.rs fetch is retried after a short interval instead of being
  remembered for the life of the process, so a network blip no longer makes a
  crate unavailable for the rest of the server's session.
- `search` ranking is retuned and result order will differ throughout. Names
  weigh more heavily against prose; a query's final word matches name prefixes,
  so partial words return results; and a query naming both a container and a
  member (`hashmap insert`) finds `HashMap::insert`, since items are now indexed
  under their ancestors' names as well as their own.
- The caches under `$CARGO_HOME/rustdoc-json/` changed format: the first lookup
  of each crate after upgrading re-parses its JSON and rebuilds its search
  index. The superseded `.rkyv1-*` sidecars are not cleaned up — delete them to
  reclaim the disk.

### Fixed

- Looking up an item in a large family of crates that glob-re-export each other
  (the ~40 `solana-*` crates found this) could overflow the stack and abort the
  server. Over-deep resolution is now abandoned the way a cycle is.
- Crates with deeply nested generic types — anything leaning on `typenum` —
  failed to load at all.
- Searching a crate for a term its documentation uses everywhere, its own name
  included, ranked the best matches last: `Regex` was unfindable in a search of
  `regex`.
- A crate could fail to resolve when its version metadata couldn't be written to
  the cache directory, and two processes resolving the same crate at once could
  race over that file.
