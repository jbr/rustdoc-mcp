Visibility: Public
Defined at: test_crate::TestStruct

A simple struct for testing basic functionality.

This struct demonstrates basic usage patterns and should show completely
since it only has one paragraph of documentation.


```rust
struct TestStruct {
    pub field: String,
    pub count: u32,
}
```

Fields:

• field: String
    A public field

• count: u32
    Another public field


Associated Types:

• pub const ASSOCIATED_CONST
    This is an associated constant for a struct

• pub fn new(field: String, count: u32) -> Self
    Create a new TestStruct

• pub fn get_field(&self) -> &str
    Get the field value

• pub fn increment_count(&mut self)
    Update the count


Implements: TestTrait, Borrow<T>, BorrowMut<T>, Clone, Debug, From<T>, Into<U>, Send, Sync, [+9 more std traits]
